Applications are now open to attend the SDSC Summer Institute 2017.

The SDSC Summer Institute is targeted at individuals interested in data science and computational science - especially current and potential users of SDSC's data-intensive resources. Familiarity with UNIX/Linux environments is recommended. Some programming experience in C/C++, Fortran, Java, R, Python, Perl, MATLAB or other languages is preferred. Applicants already dealing with data science and/or computational science problems are especially encouraged to apply.

### Room and board scholarships

In support of the Summer Institute, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), SDSC awards a limited number of scholarships to cover on-campus room and board (dorm style  private room, shared common area and bathrooms). Indicate on application if you would like to be considered for room and board scholarship. Scholarship funds only apply to room and board and are not available for any other travel expenses. Registration fee of $300 is still required from all attendees.
Summer Institute attendance and on-campus housing is limited so you are encouraged to apply early.
