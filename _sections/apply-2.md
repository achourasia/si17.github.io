### Room and board scholarships

In support of the Summer Institute, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), SDSC awards a limited number of scholarships to cover on-campus room and board (dorm style  private room, shared common area and bathrooms). Indicate on application if you would like to be considered for room and board scholarship. Scholarship funds only apply to room and board and are not available for any other travel expenses. Registration fee of $300 is still required from all attendees.
Summer Institute attendance and on-campus housing is limited so you are encouraged to apply early.
