The SDSC Summer Institute (SI) 2016: HPC for the Long Tail of Science will provide a week of education and training in High Performance and Data Intensive Computing. The Summer Institute will deploy a flexible format designed to help attendees get the most out of their week. The first half of the Summer Institute will consist of plenary sessions covering essential skills including data management, running jobs on SDSC resources, reproducibility, database systems, characteristics of big data, techniques for turning data into knowledge, software version control and making effective use of hardware. This will be followed by a series of parallel sessions that allow attendees to dive deeper into specialized material that is relevant to their research projects and covering topics in Spark, parallel computing, performance optimization, machine learning, scalable data management, visualization, GPU/CUDA and python for scientific computing.
The Summer Institute will give participants the opportunity to do hands-on exercises on both Comet, SDSC's newest supercomputer, and the data-intensive Gordon system.

The SDSC Summer Institute is targeted at individuals interested in data science and computational science - especially current and potential users of SDSC's data-intensive resources. Familiarity with UNIX/Linux environments is essential. Some programming experience in C/C++, Fortran, Java, R, Python, Perl, MATLAB or other languages is preferred. Applicants already dealing with data science and/or computational science problems are especially encouraged to apply.
